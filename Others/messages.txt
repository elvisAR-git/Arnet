6/18/18, 21:54 - Elvis.: A reality please😄
6/18/18, 21:59 - My Good Lady 😎: What does the statement -more than a friend- mean to you
6/18/18, 22:02 - Elvis.: That the person is closer than a normal friend. There's more trust and frequent sharing of thoughts and feelings. In short this relationship usually gets deeper and close to intimate
6/18/18, 22:03 - Elvis.: Its just a step away from the real thing
6/18/18, 22:11 - Elvis.: That is if not well based
6/18/18, 22:11 - My Good Lady 😎: I have written so many replies to this and erased them all..i can't find the right words
6/18/18, 22:11 - My Good Lady 😎: Do i have to ask
6/18/18, 22:12 - Elvis.: 🙆🏽‍♂😅😅😅😅
6/18/18, 22:14 - Elvis.: Okay i mean if the relationship is not based on friendship bounds, its gonna be hard to control.
6/18/18, 22:13 - My Good Lady 😎: Cheka tu😌
6/18/18, 22:14 - My Good Lady 😎: But wait..how sure are you that it gets deeper and close to intimate
6/18/18, 22:14 - Elvis.: Am not sure about that tho'...
But am judging from what i know
6/18/18, 22:15 - My Good Lady 😎: I think i get you
6/18/18, 22:15 - My Good Lady 😎: U've got experience
6/18/18, 22:16 - Elvis.: But if its on that basis. Then  a close friend is someone to be proud of
6/18/18, 22:16 - Elvis.: Noooooot precisely lets not call that xp
6/18/18, 22:17 - My Good Lady 😎: And whats the difference btwn a close friend and more than a friend
6/18/18, 22:17 - My Good Lady 😎: Okay then😏
6/18/18, 22:18 - Elvis.: The words mean the same. But when presented, they defer😄  i think a " more than friend" has more weight
6/18/18, 22:19 - My Good Lady 😎: I thought so too
6/18/18, 22:19 - Elvis.: 😊 yeah
6/18/18, 22:23 - My Good Lady 😎: So you might be both

6/20/18, 23:27 - Elvis.: 🤭khai
6/20/18, 23:28 - My Good Lady 😎: And something else about your name..there was this guy tukiwa class 4...he was more like you ..the name..the artistic nature..even the looks ...soo that got me more interested
6/20/18, 23:29 - Elvis.: 😳 haiya this' interesting go on☺
6/20/18, 23:34 - My Good Lady 😎: Sasa this is where it begins...naturally btw i have a phobia or do i call it "keeping distance" from computer geeks which apparently you are..not exactly a geek..but you get what i mean😊..and one time i look at my phone and see your text and i was like..sasa huyu aki..what do we have to talk😑..but i just agreed with my conscience to comply...
6/20/18, 23:35 - Elvis.: 🙃 oooooooh oh hizi comps zitaniaribia CV aki😊😊😊
6/20/18, 23:42 - My Good Lady 😎: So we talked..rarely but we talked sense..alafu there was a time i got really pissed ..i cant remember why but it got me pissed..but even after that..you couldnt stop talking to me and you apoloized about it and it got me thinking..hey this might be a pretty awesome guy..and i got this urge to get to know you...and so i became a little bit open..not so much..just a bit. You had this mature way of replying to texts..like i dont know..and you had this surpassing understanding of things...the simplicity..the clarity..like you knew what right words to give to everything without straining whatsover...and this just made everything complete😌
6/20/18, 23:44 - Elvis.: 🤭🤭am blushing😍

6/21/18, 19:41 - Elvis.: Heheee sasa aki
6/21/18, 19:42 - Elvis.: Tell me more about normality
6/21/18, 19:43 - My Good Lady 😎: Khai...how am i supposed to
6/21/18, 19:44 - Elvis.: How?😏 i have got no idea😌
6/21/18, 19:53 - My Good Lady 😎: Normality...okay initially the words "i love you" were used with caution..to those that merit it..but today or rather these days the same words have became worn out like a cliché..and now it has become normal for anyone to say "i love you" and normally the response anyone would give is " i love you too" or " i love you more" even though they actually don't mean it...So i did not want to say with any normality..whatsover..that i love you more... 
  
I have tried to put it in the most simplest way there is
6/21/18, 19:58 - Elvis.: Oooh i got it. I think saying the words is very normal. Though i don't use them as much as you or anyone does. I sort of understand who says them and how. I think the relationship affects the attachment of the words. In our case, I think normality is not an preference.
6/21/18, 19:59 - My Good Lady 😎: And whay should it not be
6/21/18, 19:59 - My Good Lady 😎: Why*
6/21/18, 19:59 - Elvis.: *a
6/21/18, 20:00 - Elvis.: Because i mean it when i say it, whatsoever
6/21/18, 20:01 - My Good Lady 😎: I know you do..i feel it
6/21/18, 20:03 - My Good Lady 😎: And actually i try not to mention those words..iam always real with sensitive words and very honest with them..

6/21/18, 23:25 - My Good Lady 😎: Have you been in a serious relationship with anyone..like a serious one..
6/21/18, 23:27 - Elvis.: Not really, i wouldn't say i haven't tried. Its all down right messed up. And even though i do not like hurting people i have through this
6/21/18, 23:31 - Elvis.: I'd blame it on the fact that i never really get someone who fits into my world, or rather i don't fit in Thiers... Am not quick into starting relationships so i don't get blamed when they end
6/21/18, 23:31 - Elvis.: I don't think i can handle the pressure
6/21/18, 23:32 - My Good Lady 😎: Well said..just well said 💯
6/21/18, 23:33 - Elvis.: Yeah. Thats me
6/21/18, 23:33 - Elvis.: You know am gonna ask this💁🏽‍♂
6/21/18, 23:34 - My Good Lady 😎: Allow me ask..when you say you've hurt people through this what exactly do you mean
6/21/18, 23:34 - My Good Lady 😎: Eeem...yes..yes😁
6/21/18, 23:38 - Elvis.: Yeah. There's i girl i really liked. And we had to part ways. It was sad i know but we just never seemed to be on the same train. Am a very simple and composed guy. I won't always make it on your birthday but I'll make sure i surprise you on Christmas. Its just how i am. I cannot change those facts. She couldn't keep up with this
6/21/18, 23:40 - My Good Lady 😎: And it still hurts you that it never worked out?
6/21/18, 23:41 - Elvis.: Yeah a bit. But the so called heart does move on
6/21/18, 23:42 - Elvis.: But don't get me wrong. We never fully settled for something serious. Am sure she has something better
6/21/18, 23:43 - My Good Lady 😎: This message was deleted
6/21/18, 23:44 - My Good Lady 😎: Okay..how close are we talking about here..
6/21/18, 23:44 - Elvis.: Like just more than a friend close
6/21/18, 23:45 - Elvis.: I don't know coz i just got over it fast
6/21/18, 23:46 - Elvis.: Deletes☹
6/21/18, 23:46 - My Good Lady 😎: No it was nothing
6/21/18, 23:47 - Elvis.: Okay
6/21/18, 23:47 - My Good Lady 😎: You still feel her tho
6/21/18, 23:47 - Elvis.: Noooo, noo if i did...i wouldn't even talk about her
6/21/18, 23:48 - Elvis.: Am being open coz i know it doesn't affect me now
6/21/18, 23:49 - My Good Lady 😎: Why would you not..oh thats another thing..why is it so hard for you guys to clean about your women
6/21/18, 23:50 - Elvis.: 🤣🤣 haiya wee nakupea history yangu na unauliza hivyo....n plus i have cleared with her....Jesus!😆😆
6/21/18, 23:52 - My Good Lady 😎: You wouldnt have if you were still together..thats my problem
6/21/18, 23:53 - My Good Lady 😎: So that's why nimeuliza kwanini it becomes so hard to come clean about them
6/21/18, 23:55 - Elvis.: If i was in the relationship till now, we probably wouldn't have reached this far in questions. Still if it ended bad and all cranky i would be too crushed or what to talk about it...😏
6/21/18, 23:56 - Elvis.: Honestly. I don't know how to answer this but i know that we all play the fool sometimes.
6/21/18, 23:59 - My Good Lady 😎: This is how serious it can get huh
6/21/18, 23:59 - Elvis.: It's life's way.... Irrislife
6/22/18, 00:00 - My Good Lady 😎: I think i understand now😌
6/22/18, 00:01 - Elvis.: My point is that. I have no connection with my previous attempts to relationship.
6/22/18, 00:01 - Elvis.: I knew you would
6/22/18, 00:02 - Elvis.: Am just being honest.
6/22/18, 00:02 - My Good Lady 😎: What happens if she realizes that she still needs you.
6/22/18, 00:03 - Elvis.: By then someone would have her in his arms...
6/22/18, 00:03 - Elvis.: This never happens
6/22/18, 00:03 - Elvis.: This
6/22/18, 00:04 - My Good Lady 😎: You are making this soo complex
6/22/18, 00:04 - Elvis.: Ikr🤦🏽‍♂
6/22/18, 00:05 - Elvis.: But you get that thats not gonna happen🙄
